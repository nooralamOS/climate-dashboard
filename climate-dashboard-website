        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> As the DAFRE climate dashboard team, our project was to investigate some “not so obvious” 
            effects of climate change and ideally inform the general NJ residents through a simple dashboard. 
            For this project, as a team, we split up into multiple subteams to focus on a couple of different main ideas, 
            such as Lyme disease, water contamination, and AQI. After splitting up, we spent a lot of time gathering 
            and cleaning up data on these topics. Some topics required a mix of multiple different datasets, and some just 
            required a lot of cleaning up since the data sets were sometimes up 10s of thousands of lines or even 100s of thousands of lines. 
            We then went into a more exploratory phase where we used coding languages such as Python and R in order to derive meaningful insights 
            from these datasets and hopefully come up with good correlations to show the adverse effects of “rising temperatures” or climate change. 
            Below we mentioned the main topics we worked on for this project and have detailed explanations of the work done for them.

    <section class="section-title">
        <h2>Lyme Disease Analysis</h2>
    </section>
    <div class="content">
        <p>To understand whether Lyme disease is affected by global warming and 
            increased temperatures in New Jersey, we used Lyme disease data from the New Jersey 
            Department of Health (doh.nj.gov). After encountering compatibility issues with several other 
            Lyme disease datasets, this New Jersey-specific, county-wise data provided us with more precise information. 
            Along with this large dataset, we also worked with a monthly dataset, which included one data point averaged 
            over the years 2008 to 2022 for each month, as well as another dataset containing all the monthly average temperatures.</p>
    
        <p>We initially focused on cleaning the datasets, ensuring they were New Jersey-specific, and filtering them to
             retain metrics that would help us identify meaningful correlations later on.</p>
    
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <p> One interesting thing we found was that, in general, the summer months like June, July, 
            and August were when Lyme disease cases were higher than in other months. However, an interesting 
            observation to note is that in August there is a noticeable dip in Lyme disease cases compared to June and July,
             even though August can be just as hot. After further research, we found that this decline could be attributed to a 
             combination of factors, including reduced daylight hours affecting tick activity cycles, seasonal changes in tick 
             breeding patterns, and other environmental stressors such as humidity and habitat conditions that may limit 
             tick mobility and host-seeking behavior during this period.</p>
            
            <h3>Correlation between Temperature and Lyme Disease Cases (2008-2022)</h3>
    <p><strong>Correlation coefficient: 0.7822</strong><br> 
    *This r value suggests a strong correlation between the high temperature months and higher Lyme disease cases.</p>

    <img src="https://github.com/nooralamOS/climate-dashboard/raw/main/image6.png" alt="Impact of Temperature on Monthly Lyme Disease Cases" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 160px;">

    <p>Next, we tried to do more data analytics in order to find correlations between annual Lyme disease 
        cases and annual temperatures. However, finding a consistent correlation proved to be extremely difficult 
        with Lyme disease cases in particular, due to the complex behavior patterns of ticks, their sensitivity 
        to multiple environmental factors beyond temperature alone (like humidity, vegetation, and host availability), 
        and geographical differences even within a small state like New Jersey that could cause significant 
        inconsistencies in the data. To still explore the effect of temperature on Lyme disease cases over the 
        years we had available, we normalized the number of Lyme disease cases and the temperatures to better observe 
        any trends. We also decided to exclude years after 2019, since COVID tended to cause a lot of discrepancies in the 
        results. In the graph below, the correlation ended up being around 0.305, indicating that there might not be a direct correlation. 
        However, if we had data on Lyme disease cases from the 1900s, the trends could have been much clearer, but due to limitations in 
        available datasets as well as the complexities that follow the study of ticks and Lyme disease, there wasn’t an
         exact correlation indicating a direct effect of temperature on Lyme disease.</p>

            <h3>AQI Analysis</h3>

            <p>We used the air quality data from <a href="https://www.epa.gov/" target="_blank">epa.gov</a>, and 
                correlated different measures from it with average annual temperature. Measures included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avg. Max AQI</li>
                <li>Avg. Median AQI</li>
                <li>Avg Number of Good Days</li>
                <li>Avg Number of Bad Days</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>The time frame we chose was <strong>[2000, 2018]</strong>. We selected this period because the AQI dataset 
                was only complete starting in 1996, so we decided on 2000 as the standard year to begin our analysis. We chose 
                2018 as the last year of analysis in order to achieve more general results, as the years 2019-2022 are considered 
                abnormal, particularly regarding pollution metrics, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
        
            <p>To clean the data, we first narrowed the dataset down to New Jersey only, then we took the average across 
                all counties to get an average for NJ. Additionally, we used the same temperature dataset from the Lyme 
                disease analysis, following the same data cleaning procedure. <strong>NOTE:</strong> All values were normalized for 
                graphing and correlation testing.</p>
        
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p><strong>Max AQI vs Annual Temperature (2000-2018) in NJ</strong></p>

            <p>
                The correlation is not statistically significant at 0.1 level as p-value is high. This shows that the correlation we found for these 2 data points is likely due to chance.

            <p>

            <p>The correlation is statistically significant at the 0.1 level as the p-value is lower than 0.1. 
                This means that there is a high chance that our correlation is not due to chance.</p>

            <p>The correlation is not statistically significant at the 0.1 level as the p-value is high. This means that our correlation here is likely due to chance and not a real effect.</p>

            <h3>Additional Analysis</h3>
            <p>In addition, there is also code in the notebook where we used a 1-10 year delay for all the analyses above to introduce a time delay. 
                The results were not statistically significant for those cases.
                Lastly, we also broke down each of the analyses above by county instead of using the state average. 
                The results were not much better than those from the state average.</p>
